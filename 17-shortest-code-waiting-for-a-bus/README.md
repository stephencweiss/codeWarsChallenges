Example
time='06:00',km=1    sc('06:00',1)='06:02'
John start waiting at 06:00, a Bus start at 06:00
Bus travel 1 km with 2 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 06:02

time='06:00',km=10   sc('06:00',10)='06:20'
John start waiting at 06:00, a Bus start at 06:00
Bus travel 10 km with 20 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 06:20

time='07:00',km=10   sc('07:00',10)='07:05'
John start waiting at 07:00, a Bus start at 06:45
Bus travel 10 km with 20 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 07:05

time='10:00',km=100  sc('10:00',100)='10:05'
John start waiting at 10:00, a Bus start at 06:45
Bus travel 100 km with 3 hours 20 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 10:05

time='09:00',km=100  sc('09:00',100)='09:20'
John start waiting at 10:00, a Bus start at 06:00
Bus travel 100 km with 3 hours 20 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 09:20

some edge case:

time='05:00',km=1    sc('05:00',1)='06:02'
John start waiting at 05:00, a Bus start at 06:00
(John gets up too early, so he should waiting a long times)
Bus travel 1 km with 2 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 06:02

time='20:00',km=1    sc('20:00',1)='20:02'
John start waiting at 20:00, a Bus start at 20:00
(John caught up with the last bus)
Bus travel 1 km with 2 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 20:02

time='20:10',km=1    sc('20:10'ï¼Œ1)='06:02'
John start waiting at 20:00, a Bus start at next day 06:00
(John didn't catch the last bus, he should waiting to next day)
Bus travel 1 km with 2 minutes, so John take on the Bus at 06:02
